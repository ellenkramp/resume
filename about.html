                <p><span class="quote"><br>My path in the professional world started out at an IT Helpdesk</span> despite having majored in mass communications.
                What seemed like a disappointing first gig inconspicuously laid the foundation for my future career path. It was through this
                position that I was introduced to software, becoming familiar with troubleshooting and reporting bugs, acting as a liaison between 
                customers and software engineers. 
                <br><br>
                Still, I desired to carry out the blueprint on my Bachelor's degree. I entered into a position in
                marketing and communications, pursuing what I thought was the "right path". When my company's website needed an overhaul,
                I began tinkering with simple web design and javascript programming, and realized this was what I was truly passionate about.
                <br><br>
                I scowered the web for resources and began teaching myself web development.
                While I was making a lot of progress on my own, I felt that I was in need of two things to turn my newfound passion into a career: 
                more time to learn, and a support system of other software developers. That's when I took the plunge and quit my job to pursue coding full-time in an immersive bootcamp.
                <br><br>
                I am finally in my element, thriving on unique application of both creativity and logic that is 
                so intrinsic to software engineering.
